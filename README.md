Stupid Cloud Tricks

the idea is to add some fun little coding tricks here using Cloudflare and other stuff.

## What's my IP

A little cloudflare script that just returns info about where the Cloudflare function ran.

Keep a list of locations in a kv and show stats on this.



## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This project is deployed to Cloudflare Pages. The build command is `npm run build` and the build output directory is `.svelte-kit/cloudflare`.

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- None currently defined
